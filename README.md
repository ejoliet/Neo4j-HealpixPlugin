Neo4j-HealpixPlugin
===================

Neo4j server healpix spatial plugin 

Neo4j server can be extended to use plugin. 
Healpix is a sphere pixelisation scheme heavily used in astronomy projects and space missions such as Planck and WMAP.
HEALPix website: http://healpix.sourceforge.net/

Started to use Healpix in Fortran more than 10 years ago and developped in Java more recently.

The idea here is to take advantage of both the HEALpix scheme and the graph database for highly structured datasets.

Neo4j server allow extensions via plugins.

This repository contain all necesary code to build the plugin and add it to your server.
